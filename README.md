# Medievil Poptracker

Due to the way the game deals with key items, it's hard to see what exactly you have on you at times. This will help resolve the issue.

# To Use

- Download [Poptracker](https://github.com/black-sliver/PopTracker/releases)
- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/riezahughes/MedievilAp-Poptracker/releases) of this pack
- Put the zip file into the "packs" folder of poptracker
- run poptracker and load the pack
- click the "ap" icon and connect to your AP game!
- click the settings icon next to AP icon and set your chosen options.

# Notes

No autotracking for locations.
